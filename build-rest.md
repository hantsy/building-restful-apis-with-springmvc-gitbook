#Build REST APIs


In this sample application, we will implement a simple blog application.


##Features 

For a end user view, a basic Blog application should includes the following features.

1. Login.
2. Logout.
3. Change password.
4. Change user profile.
5. Post a new blog entry.
6. Comment on the existing blog after logged in.

An Admin user should have some privileges to do some advanced operations, e.g.

1. User management.
2. Others.

You can consider the above list as the original requirements gathered from the customer, you could have to combine the technical factors when you plan your project.

## Project Plan

I would like embrace Agile in my projects, especially the scrum methodology. 

1. Put all features into a backlog.
2. Order the features by their priorities.
3. Split them in several sprints.
